# SWT-Widgets


This repository collects some of my favourite SWT widgets. 

Some of those widgets are ported from other open source projects, others are written by myself. The reasons why I port codes from other open source projects instead of using them directly are: 

1. I don't want my project depends on too many other projects, since it's hard to mange a lot of dependencies.
2. Sometimes I have to modify the widgets to satisfy my own requirements.
